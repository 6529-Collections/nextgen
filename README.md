# NextGen

NextGen is a Next Generation smart-contract based on the ERC721 standard that allows you to create multiple ERC721 tokens under a single smart contract. NextGen supports the creation of generative art NFTs as well as the generation of the corresponding metadata using fully on-chain data rather than depending on distributed storage metadata.

This repo contains the smart contract as well as the docs of the NextGen smart contract.
